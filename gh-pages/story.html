        <p>
            Intuitively, what words might work well for a first guess in the game?
        </p>
        <p>
            A natural thought is to figure out in early guesses which vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') exist in the target, since a word must contain at least one vowel.
        </p>

        <p>More generally, one might consider words composed of common characters (including the vowels) over rare characters. The response for common characters would help eliminate more candidates for the next guess.
        </p>
        <p> That leads to the first heuristic rule:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heuristic Rule</strong>: Give favour to words composed of common characters rather than rare characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scoring Function</strong>: Let ${f_T}(c)$ be the frequency count of a character $c$ among words from a target set $T$. Then the score of a guess word with unique characters $c_1, c_2, ..., c_k$ could be taken as the sum $\sum_{j=0}^{k} {f_T}(c_j)$. A guess word in $T$ with the highest score would be the next guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the first guess, the same heuristic rule can be applied in subsequent guesses by scoring with updated  character frequencies $f_{T_i}$, where $T_i$ is the set of remaining candidates at the $i$-th guess.
        </p>
        ~~~
        <p>
            On the other hand, sometimes, one might wish to guess words not listed in the remaining candidates. For example, consider words that end with "-ound". There are over eight of them (e.g. "bound", "pound", "mound", "sound", etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the remaining candidates only consist of these "-ound" words, a better guess word could be e.g. "plumb" since it has more significant letters ('p', 'b', and 'm') of those "-ound" words.
        </p>
        <p> That leads to an adjusted heuristic rule:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Adjusted Heuristic Rule</strong>: Consider all possible guess words and give favour to words composed of significant characters by excluding characters already shared by all remaining candidates.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Scoring Function</strong>: Let $G$ be the set of all possible guess words. At the $i$-th guess, let $T_i$ be the set of remaining candidates. Let $f_{T_i}(c)$ be the frequency of a character $c$ among words from $T_i$, and $X_{i}$ be the set of characters that appear in every word from $T_i$.<br>
            Then the score of a guess word with unique characters $c_1, c_2, ..., c_k$ could be taken as the sum
            $$\sum_{j=0, c_j \notin X_{i}}^{k} f_{T_i}(c_j)$$
            A guess word in $G$ with the highest score would be the next guess.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            <strong>Result</strong>: With the adjusted heuristic rule, the solver can guess <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiking0501/Wordle-Solver/master/data/small-ordered.txt" target="_blank"><strong>all 2315 words <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color:inherit"></i></strong></a> within <strong>six guesses</strong> using first guesses such as "raise", "later", or "snare".

        <p>
            The discussed heuristic rule gives favour to words composed of significant characters, such that any response given towards the word could provide useful information for selecting the next guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            Could we better formulate the "information" provided by these possible responses?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Formulation</strong>: Given a guess word, consider the set of $R$ possible responses $x_1, x_2, ..., x_R$ recieved by this word, where each response $x_j$ is a color code indicating how close the guess word is to a potential target word.
        </p>
        <p>Then one might formulate the information of the responses as a response distribution $d$,  where $d(x_j)$ counts the number of responses $x_j$ the guess word receives over all possible target words.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Intuition</strong>: The response distribution gives clues on how useful the information is provided by the guess word.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, a good guess word should have its response distribution spread out evenly, that is, the response outcomes are diversified rather than clustered. Otherwise, little information is provided for selecting the next guess when the response outcomes of a guess word are mostly identical.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Information Entropy</strong>: In information theory, this level of "information" of the response outcomes could be measured. Define a discrete random variable $X$ with $R$ response outcomes $x_1, x_2, ..., x_R$, where each response $x_j$ occurs with a probability $p(x_j) = \frac{d(x_j)}{R}$. Then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank"><strong>Shannon Entropy</strong></a> of $X$ is defined as:
            $$ - \sum_{j=1}^{R} p(x_i) \log p(x_i) $$
        </p>
        <p>
            The entropy value is higher when the response distribution is more even, thus gives a decent reflection of how useful the information from the possible responses is for selecting the next guess.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation</strong>: At each guess time, simply computes the information entropy for all potential response outcomes from all guess words. The word with the maximum information entropy would be selected as the next guess word.
        </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            <strong>Result</strong>:  While the entropy computation takes much time, the solver can guess <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiking0501/Wordle-Solver/master/data/small-ordered.txt" target="_blank"><strong>all 2315 words <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true" style="color:inherit"></i></strong></a> within <strong>five guesses</strong> using first guesses such as "react".

            "Hey," I said, skimming through the updates of my social media. "Have you tried the <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/" target="_blank"><strong>Wordle daily challenges</strong></a>?"
        </p>
        <p> "Nope, what's that?" He asked.
        </p>
        <p> Quickly after two guesses in the game, he started searching for five-letter dictionaries online. "Don't cheat," I giggled as I watched him scanning through the dictionary words one by one. Finally, he commented, "this game should be tackled by a computer program. I bet it would be fairly easy to write a solver."
        </p>
        <p> "Yeh, let's try that out. I bet my solver is going to beat yours. "

        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">
            Finally, my strategy got a six and his strategy got a five for the worst number of guesses. However, mine runs much faster. That counts as my win, I would say. <i class="fa fa-coffee close-coffee" onclick="toggleSession('nightDetails')"></i>
